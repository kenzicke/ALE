# README for "Alkalinity enrichment stimulates calcification and linear extension in *Acropora cervicornis*" Dataset & CodeThis archive contains the data and R code used to generate the results and figures for the manuscript:**Cooke et al. (2025), "Alkalinity enrichment stimulates calcification and linear extension in *Acropora cervicornis*"**The dataset includes raw coral growth measurements, carbonate chemistry samples, and a complete R Markdown script used to analyze and visualize the results. All growth rate calculations were conducted outside of R for clarity, and the processed growth rates are included in `growth_raw.csv`. Raw inputs used to generate those rates are also provided.---## ?? Contents- `Cooke_2025.Rmd` Ñ R Markdown file containing all statistical analyses and plots.- `growth_raw.csv` Ñ Processed growth rates used in the analysis.- `bottle_raw.csv` Ñ Carbonate chemistry data from experimental bottle samples.- `ipam_raw.csv` Ñ Photophysiology data (raw fluorescence measurements).- `bw_corrected.csv` Ñ Raw buoyant weight data and salinity-corrected dry weights.- `le_raw.csv` Ñ Raw skeletal length measurements and scale standard data.---## Description of Key Data Files### `growth_raw.csv`Contains pre-calculated coral growth rates used in all figures and analyses. Growth was derived from buoyant weight (calcification) and length measurements (linear extension) using the raw data in the files below.#### Metadata Columns- `order` Ñ Internal row ordering (for sorting)- `beaker`, `tank`, `treatment`, `geno`, `tag`, `Coral` Ñ Identifiers#### Growth Variables- `gr_` Ñ Calcification rate (mg cm?? day??)- `le_` Ñ Linear extension rate (mm day??)#### Time Intervals- `t0t1`, `t1t2`, `t2t3` Ñ Individual intervals- `t0t3`, `t1t3` Ñ Cumulative intervals> Variables ending in `e` (e.g., `le_t0t1e`) are offset-corrected. All statistical analyses were conducted using these corrected values.---### `bw_corrected.csv`Contains raw buoyant weight measurements and temperature- and salinity-corrected dry weights, used to calculate calcification rates.#### Identifiers- `Date` Ñ Measurement date  - `TP` Ñ Experimental timepoint (e.g., T0, T1, T2, T3)  - `Genotype` Ñ Coral genotype ID  - `Tag` Ñ Coral tag number  #### Measurement Variables- `Temp (C)` Ñ Temperature at time of measurement (¡C)  - `wet weight (g)` Ñ Measured buoyant weight (g)  - `Salinity (ppt)` Ñ Measured salinity (ppt)  - `calcDensity` Ñ Calculated seawater density based on salinity and temperature  - `Density of seawater (g/cm3)` Ñ Redundant with `calcDensity`; included for clarity  - `Density of aragonite (g/cm3)` Ñ Reference density of aragonite (typically ~2.93 g/cm?)  #### Derived Values- `Density (seawater/aragonite)` Ñ Ratio of seawater to aragonite density  - `1 - [Density (SW/A)]` Ñ Correction factor used in buoyant weight-to-dry weight conversion  - `Dry weight (g)` Ñ Salinity- and temperature-corrected skeletal dry weight (g)  - `Initial SurfaceArea (cm2)` Ñ Surface area of each coral fragment at experiment start > These values were used to derive calcification rates reported in `growth_raw.csv`. Growth rate calculations were performed externally (e.g., in spreadsheet software) and are not included in the R code, but all necessary raw data are provided for reproducibility.---### `le_raw.csv`Contains raw skeletal length measurements used to calculate linear extension rates.#### Identifiers- `Date` Ñ Measurement date  - `Genotype` Ñ Coral genotype ID  - `Tag` Ñ Coral tag number  - `Tank` Ñ Tank number  - `TP` Ñ Experimental timepoint (e.g., T0, T1, T2, T3)  #### Measurement Variable- `LE (mm)` Ñ Measured linear extension (length) of coral skeleton in millimeters> These measurements were used to derive linear extension rates reported in `growth_raw.csv`. Growth rate calculations were performed externally and are not included in the R code, but the raw values are provided to enable reproducibility.---### `bottle_raw.csv`Carbonate chemistry measurements used to calculate pH, ½arag, and other parameters using `seacarb`.- `Date`, `beaker`, `Coral`, `Treatment` Ñ Identifiers- `Salinity`, `temp`, `dbar` Ñ Environmental metadata- `DIC`, `ta1`, `ta2`, `Avg.TA` Ñ Carbonate system data- `diff`, `delta` Ñ QA/QC and flags- ÔprecipÕ Ñ Notes whether precipitation was visually observed in the sample bottle  ---## Running the Code1. Open `Cooke_2025.Rmd` in RStudio.2. Ensure all files listed above are located in the **same working directory**.3. Knit or run the script from top to bottom to reproduce all analyses and figures.> Note: The R script uses `growth_raw.csv` as its starting point. The raw measurements used to calculate these growth rates are provided separately in `bw_measurements.csv` and `le_measurements.csv`.---## R Package DependenciesThe analysis uses the following R packages:`broom`, `dplyr`, `emmeans`, `flextable`, `geomtextpath`, `ggplot2`, `ggpubr`,  `ggsignif`, `grid`, `lmerTest`, `metR`, `multcomp`, `multcompView`, `nlstools`,  `officer`, `patchwork`, `seacarb`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`, `writexl`---## ContactFor questions or additional information, please contact:**Kenzie Cooke**  University of Miami  kmc390@miami.edu
